            <h3>The Prize Pool & Initial Funding</h3>
            <p>There will be many deciding factors on how much the prize pool will be, including the competitors themselves, sponsors, and potential donors. 
                We are aiming for all of this to happen on chain and be as transparent as possible.
                The fund will be bootstrapped from NFT sales, and all competitors will pay a very small entry fee for a chance at the prize.  This entire process will be 100% automated. The prize pot, and entry fee portions that will contribute to the grand prize will automatically go into a smart contract, dedicated to paying out to the winning student. This will happen on chain, and be transparent. 
                The amount of funds from the entry fees, which will go towards the final jackpot will be variable. If we have 1 million competitors vs 10,000 competitors, then the percentage dedicated towards the jackpot will change. We want the jackpot to make a substantial difference in terms of tuition, not just a portion of it. And not only for one year, but every year. Thus, we must calculate how much will go towards this year, vs next yearâ€™s competition. .</p>

                <h3>Outside Contributors</h3>
                    <p>ADAScholars will do its best to get other outside entities to contribute to this cause, and encourage anybody who is interested in this project to reach out if they are interested in becoming a contributor. (You will have your own custom NFT as a thank you).  That being said, sometimes just tweeting, posting, or commenting about this project can help increase the prize pot by raising awareness. 
                        The ultimate goal of this project is to have as many tournaments throughout the year as possible, thus giving as many students as possible, a better chance at higher education..</p>
