            <h3>cNFTs Page</h3>
            <p>These NFTs are generated by an established artist in the cNFT community. His pieces are derived from
                training AI over countless hours, indexing myriad of chess pieces, connecting multiple neural networks,
                and painstakingly rendering new art from the mind of a computer. How fantastic is that? Each piece is a
                work of art in itself. See samples below.
                I would advise those who are interested in contributing to our cause, to buy these purely as art.
                That being said, these NFTs MAY have some actual utility on the platform down the road. Perhaps
                recording player data inside the NFT itself for example (the game will open to general public, more on
                that below). Aside from the artistic value, it will give the hodler of the NFT a badge of honor in the ADA
                community. You contributed to a cause.
                And that’s what this tournament is all about. Making a positive impact and helping students who are
                interested in mathematics, and other STEM fields, a fair chance at winning a scholarship.</p>

                <h3>cNFT Whales</h3>
                    <p>ADA Whales – If you contribute 10,000+ ADA to this cause, our artist will generate an AI redendered
                        customer NFT of whatever you choose. If you provide us a couple of pictures of yourself, you can have
                        our AI generate an NFT avatar that is fully yours. You like rocket ships? We’ll train our AI for rocket
                        images. Whatever theme or motif you choose for an avatar, we will generate an NFT that is 1 of 1, and
                        only yours. And because each AI generated piece can never be replicated, you’ll be the only owner ever
                        who has that specific NFT.</p>
