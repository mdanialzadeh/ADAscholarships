                    <h3>About Us</h3>
                    <p>AdaScholar is a competitive gaming (Chess as first release) platform, for awarding scholarships to high
                        school students on the Cardano blockchain.
                        Students will sign up through our portal. After registration is complete, students will be onboarded into
                        the gaming platform. Inside the platform, they can enter their details, so they’re matched with
                        complimentary opponents in their respective regions.
                        The game will have a few rounds to determine ranks. This will be the calibration phase to make sure
                        each player is in the correct tranche.
                        Once a player is ranked based on win / loss ratios, they’ll enter into brackets. Brackets will be based on
                        ranks. Eventually going down to a final game between two opponents, and the winner being awarded a
                        yet to be determined amount towards college tuition. Please note – the final game will either have to be
                        in person, or with a camera in a specific isolated area to make sure no one is cheating. This should
                        discourage would be cheaters from cheating online, because during the finals, they simply can’t. It will
                        be most likely broadcast in some form. (maybe? I want your thoughts on this Anthony).
                        This will be purely based on skill. The best competitor will win.</p>

                <h3>cNFTs Page</h3>
                <p>These NFTs are generated by an established artist in the cNFT community. His pieces are derived from
                    training AI over countless hours, indexing myriad of chess pieces, connecting multiple neural networks,
                    and painstakingly rendering new art from the mind of a computer. How fantastic is that? Each piece is a
                    work of art in itself. See samples below.
                    I would advise those who are interested in contributing to our cause, to buy these purely as art.
                    That being said, these NFTs MAY have some actual utility on the platform down the road. Perhaps
                    recording player data inside the NFT itself for example (the game will open to general public, more on
                    that below). Aside from the artistic value, it will give the hodler of the NFT a badge of honor in the ADA
                    community. You contributed to a cause.
                    And that’s what this tournament is all about. Making a positive impact and helping students who are
                    interested in mathematics, and other STEM fields, a fair chance at winning a scholarship.</p>

                    <h3>cNFT Whales</h3>
                    <p>ADA Whales – If you contribute 10,000+ ADA to this cause, our artist will generate an AI redendered
                        customer NFT of whatever you choose. If you provide us a couple of pictures of yourself, you can have
                        our AI generate an NFT avatar that is fully yours. You like rocket ships? We’ll train our AI for rocket
                        images. Whatever theme or motif you choose for an avatar, we will generate an NFT that is 1 of 1, and
                        only yours. And because each AI generated piece can never be replicated, you’ll be the only owner ever
                        who has that specific NFT.</p>
