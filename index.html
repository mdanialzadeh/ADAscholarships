                    <h3>About Us</h3>
                    <p>AdaScholar is a competitive gaming (Chess as first release) platform, for awarding scholarships to high school students on the Cardano blockchain.
                        Students will sign up through our portal. After registration is complete, students will be onboarded into
                        the gaming platform. Inside the platform, they can enter their details, so they’re matched with
                        complimentary opponents in their respective regions.
                        <br><br>
                        The game will have a few rounds to determine ranks. This will be the calibration phase to make sure
                        each player is in the correct tranche.
                        Once a player is ranked based on win / loss ratios, they’ll enter into brackets. Brackets will be based on
                        ranks. Eventually going down to a final game between two opponents, and the winner being awarded a
                        yet to be determined amount towards college tuition.
                        <br><br>
                        Please note – the final game will either have to be
                        in person, or with a camera in a specific isolated area to make sure no one is cheating. This should
                        discourage would be cheaters from cheating online, because during the finals, they simply can’t. It will
                        be most likely broadcast in some form. (maybe? I want your thoughts on this Anthony).
                        This will be purely based on skill. The best competitor will win.</p>

                            <p>During the next few months, ADAScholars will leave this page open for students who may be interested to pre-register. If you’re a high schooler who is good at chess, we encourage you to sign up. Globally. 
                                To further help our project have maximum impact during the first tournament, we are having an NFT sale. </p>

                            <h3>Open Competition</h3>
                            <p>In addition, we will open the chess tournaments to the general public. By this time, the game would be fully developed, and be able to accommodate a much broader audience. And this is how we will ensure the prize pot for students will always have funds. A percentage from the entry fees of the general public competition, will go towards the scholarship prize pot.
                                <br> 
                                An overly simplistic example would be the following. General public competition #1 entry fee is 10 ADA. 1 Ada will be diverted to scholarship fund, 9 ADA will go into prize pot. This will ensure the scholarship fund is always funded. </p>
